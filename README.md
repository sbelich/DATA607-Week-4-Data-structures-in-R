# DATA607-Week-4-Data-structures-in-R
Transform data between wide and long formats using tidyr package.  
Change shapes of data frames using dplyr package.  
Perform data transformations to support downstream data analysis.

Find (or create) an example of an untidy dataset—for example, 
a “wide” table of descriptive data taken from an HTML page.  
You should also describe some kind of analysis that might be 
performed on the data.  You should not tidy, transform, or analyze 
the data here, since that will be one part of your Project 2 
deliverable (which is also available in your week 5 folder!).  
Please see my sample post, which is taken from your Week 5 assignment.
